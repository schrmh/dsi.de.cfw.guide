We will now use pre-made scripts to simplify the installation of homebrew entrypoints. These entrypoints will allow us to load homebrew within seconds of launching the target application.

Using 4swordshax will only allow you to run emulators and homebrew applications. If you would like to run commercial roms using SRLoader, we recommend installing [sudokuhax](/guide/installing-sudokuhax) instead of 4swordshax.

## What you need

* The [twlnf entrypoint installation pack](/assets/files/twlnf-entrypoint-pack.zip)

1. Insert your device's SD card into your computer

3. Unplug your SD card, and insert it in your DSi

## Installing your Entrypoint

  - This may take a few minutes
  - Store this NAND backup in a safe location, it is a critical backup
2. Press **X** to mount the NAND directly

  - twlnf does not list this as an option

3. Navigate to the .nfs script corresponding with the DSiWare you have
  - Fieldrunners - `install_fieldrunhax_usa.nfs`
  - Legends of Exidia - `install_exidiahax_usa.nfs`
  - Guitar Rock Tour - `install_grtpwn_usa.nfs`
  -  The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Anniversary - `install_4swordshax_usa.nfs`
4. Press **A** to execute the script
  - If the dry run fails, you do not have the DSiWare installed
