This guide only supports USA consoles for now.
{: .notice--info}

We now have the option of installing multiple various entrypoints, allowing us to avoid running ugopwn every time we want to launch homebrew. This guide uses ugopwn, which is only supported on USA consoles for now, to install your entrypoint. A release of ugopwn for EUR and JPN consoles has been promised soon.

This is only necessary if you do not wish to install HiyaCFW, but want a homebrew entrypoint on your system.

If you already have one of the following titles:

* Fieldrunners
* Legends of Exidia
* Guitar Rock Tour
* The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Anniversary

follow the **Installing an Entrypoint (pre-owned title)** guide, which contains twlnf scripts to install the hacked save.

Otherwise, follow the **Installing Sudokuhax** guide, which will install an older version of Sudoku, as well as a corresponding hacked save.
